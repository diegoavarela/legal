# Privacy Policy

**Freelance Tasklist**

*Last updated: December 21, 2024*

## Overview

Freelance Tasklist ("the App") is a task management application developed by Diego Varela. Your privacy is important to us, and this policy explains how we handle your information.

## Data Collection

**We do not collect any personal data.**

The App operates entirely on your device and through your personal iCloud account. We have no servers, no analytics, and no tracking.

## Data Storage

All your data (tasks, folders, tags, and settings) is stored:

1. **Locally on your device** - Your data is stored in a local database on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac.

2. **In your personal iCloud account** - If you have iCloud enabled, your data syncs across your devices using Apple's CloudKit service. This data is stored in your private iCloud container and is only accessible by you.

We cannot access, view, or retrieve any of your data. Your tasks, folders, and any information you enter in the App remain completely private.

## Third-Party Services

The App uses the following Apple services:

- **iCloud CloudKit**: For syncing your data across your devices. This is governed by [Apple's Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/).
- **Apple Push Notifications**: For task reminders. No personal data is transmitted.

We do not use any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.

## Data Sharing

We do not share any data with third parties because we do not have access to your data.

## Data Retention

Your data remains on your device and in your iCloud account until you choose to delete it. Uninstalling the App will remove local data. To remove iCloud data, you can delete it from your iCloud settings.

## Children's Privacy

The App does not knowingly collect any information from children. The App contains no advertising, in-app purchases targeting children, or social features.

## Your Rights

Since all data is stored locally and in your personal iCloud account, you have complete control over your data. You can:

- Export your data at any time
- Delete individual items or all data
- Disable iCloud sync to keep data only on your device

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by updating the "Last updated" date at the top of this policy.
