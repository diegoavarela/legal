Welcome to the Freelance Tasklist support page. Here you'll find answers to common questions and ways to get help.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### General

**Q: How do I create a new task?**
A: Tap the "+" button or use the keyboard shortcut `⌘N` (Mac) to create a new task. You can also use the menu bar widget for quick task creation.

**Q: How do I organize tasks into folders?**
A: Create folders from the sidebar using `⌘⇧N` or the "+" button next to "Folders". Then assign tasks to folders when creating or editing them.

**Q: How do I set a due date?**
A: When creating or editing a task, tap on the date field to select a due date and optionally a time for reminders.

### Sync & iCloud

**Q: How does sync work?**
A: Freelance Tasklist uses iCloud to sync your data across all your Apple devices. Make sure you're signed into the same iCloud account on all devices and that iCloud is enabled for the App.

**Q: My tasks aren't syncing. What should I do?**
A: Try these steps:
1. Check that you're signed into iCloud on all devices
2. Ensure iCloud Drive is enabled in Settings > [Your Name] > iCloud
3. Check your internet connection
4. Force quit and reopen the App
5. Wait a few minutes - sync can sometimes take time

**Q: Can I use the App without iCloud?**
A: Yes, the App works fully offline. Your data will be stored locally on your device.

### Features

**Q: What keyboard shortcuts are available?**
A: Press `⌘/` to see all available keyboard shortcuts, including:
- `⌘N` - New task
- `⌘⇧N` - New folder
- `⌘⌥N` - New tag
- `⌘T` - Show today's tasks
- `⌘F` - Search

**Q: How do recurring tasks work?**
A: When editing a task, you can set a recurrence pattern (daily, weekly, monthly, etc.). When you complete a recurring task, a new instance is automatically created.

**Q: Can I get reminders for tasks?**
A: Yes, set a due date with a specific time, and you'll receive a notification when the task is due. Make sure notifications are enabled for Freelance Tasklist in System Settings.

## Troubleshooting
