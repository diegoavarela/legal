# FDA Regulatory Classification: HeartStrong

**Document Date: December 25, 2024**

## Executive Summary

HeartStrong is classified as a **General Wellness Product** under FDA guidance, NOT as a medical device. This document outlines the regulatory basis for this classification.

## Classification: General Wellness Product

### Applicable FDA Guidance

HeartStrong falls under the FDA's "General Wellness: Policy for Low Risk Devices" guidance (September 2019), which states that certain products are not regulated as medical devices.

### Criteria Met for General Wellness Classification

#### 1. Intended Use - General Wellness

HeartStrong is intended only for general wellness purposes:
- **Fitness tracking**: Recording workouts, duration, and perceived exertion
- **Exercise motivation**: Encouraging physical activity
- **Progress visualization**: Showing fitness trends over time
- **Educational content**: General information about exercise

The App does NOT:
- Diagnose any disease or condition
- Treat any disease or condition
- Cure or mitigate any disease or condition
- Monitor vital signs for medical purposes

#### 2. Low Risk

HeartStrong presents low risk because:
- It does not make specific medical claims
- It does not replace clinical judgment
- It encourages users to consult healthcare providers
- It provides general fitness guidance, not medical prescriptions

### What HeartStrong Does NOT Do

| Medical Device Function | HeartStrong |
|------------------------|-------------|
| Diagnose heart conditions | NO |
| Prescribe exercise as treatment | NO |
| Monitor for arrhythmias | NO |
| Alert for medical emergencies | NO |
| Replace cardiac rehabilitation | NO |
| Provide individualized medical advice | NO |

### What HeartStrong DOES Do

| General Wellness Function | HeartStrong |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| Track workout completion | YES |
| Log perceived exertion (RPE) | YES |
| Provide general fitness education | YES |
| Suggest workout structure | YES |
| Track progress over time | YES |
| Encourage healthy habits | YES |

## Distinguishing from Medical Devices

### Not a Cardiac Rehabilitation Device

HeartStrong is NOT a cardiac rehabilitation program substitute:
- Does not require physician prescription
- Does not provide ECG/EKG monitoring
- Does not track specific cardiac metrics for diagnosis
- Does not integrate with clinical systems
- Recommends consulting transplant team for medical decisions

### Not a Vital Signs Monitor

While the App may read heart rate from HealthKit:
- This is for general fitness awareness only
- No medical interpretation is provided
- No alerts based on cardiac readings
- RPE (subjective) is primary measure, not heart rate

### Not a Symptom Diagnostic Tool

The App allows users to log post-workout symptoms:
- This is for personal record-keeping only
- No diagnosis is provided based on symptoms
- App explicitly recommends seeking medical care for concerning symptoms
- Symptom data is not analyzed for medical conclusions

## User Notifications

HeartStrong clearly communicates its non-medical nature through:

### 1. Onboarding Disclaimer
Before using the App, users must acknowledge:
- The App is not a medical device
- The App does not provide medical advice
- Users should consult their healthcare provider
- Exercise carries inherent risks

### 2. In-App Reminders
Throughout the App:
- Warnings to stop if experiencing symptoms
- Reminders to consult transplant team
- Clear labeling of content as "fitness guidance" not "medical advice"

### 3. Terms of Service
Legal documentation clearly states:
- No medical claims are made
- User assumes risk of exercise
- Healthcare provider consultation is required

## Regulatory Maintenance

### Ongoing Compliance

To maintain General Wellness classification:
- No marketing claims about treating or diagnosing conditions
- No claims about improving transplant outcomes
- No specific health claims beyond general fitness
- Regular review of content for medical claim creep

### Red Lines - Would Require FDA Review

The following changes would potentially require FDA medical device review:
- Adding arrhythmia detection
- Providing medication reminders with clinical intent
- Claiming to reduce rejection risk
- Integrating with clinical monitoring systems
- Providing personalized treatment recommendations

## Conclusion

HeartStrong is appropriately classified as a General Wellness Product because:

1. **Intended Use**: General fitness and wellness, not medical treatment
2. **Claims**: No diagnostic or therapeutic claims
3. **Risk Level**: Low risk, encourages professional consultation
4. **User Population**: While designed for transplant recipients, provides fitness guidance appropriate for their needs without making medical claims

This classification is consistent with FDA's approach to fitness apps that:
- Promote general health and wellness
- Do not claim to diagnose or treat specific conditions
- Encourage users to seek appropriate medical care
