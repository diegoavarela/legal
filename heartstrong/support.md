## About HeartStrong

HeartStrong is a fitness and wellness app designed specifically for heart transplant recipients. We understand your unique journey and provide workouts, training plans, and progress tracking tailored to your recovery stage.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Getting Started

**Q: How do I set up my profile?**
A: When you first open HeartStrong, you'll be guided through a setup process where you can enter your transplant date, current recovery stage, and fitness goals. This helps us personalize your workout recommendations.

**Q: Why does HeartStrong ask for my transplant date?**
A: Your transplant date helps us understand where you are in your recovery journey. We adjust workout intensity and recommendations based on your recovery stage.

### Workouts

**Q: What is RPE?**
A: RPE stands for Rate of Perceived Exertion. It's a scale from 6-20 that measures how hard you feel you're working. Since heart transplant recipients have a denervated heart (slower heart rate response), RPE is a more reliable indicator of effort than heart rate.

**Q: Why are the warmups so long?**
A: Heart transplant recipients have a denervated heart that responds more slowly to exercise. Extended warmups (10-15 minutes) allow your heart rate to gradually increase to match your activity level.

**Q: Can I skip the cooldown?**
A: We strongly recommend completing cooldowns. Your heart rate decreases more slowly after transplant, so proper cooldowns help prevent dizziness and allow for gradual recovery.

### Health & Safety

**Q: Is HeartStrong a replacement for medical advice?**
A: No. HeartStrong is a fitness tool, not a medical device. Always consult your transplant team or cardiologist before starting any exercise program.

**Q: What should I do if I feel unwell during a workout?**
A: Stop exercising immediately. If symptoms persist, contact your healthcare provider. HeartStrong includes symptom logging to help you track how you feel, but this is for your records only - not for medical diagnosis.

### Data & Privacy

**Q: Where is my data stored?**
A: All your workout data, health information, and profile details are stored locally on your device. If you enable cloud sync, data is encrypted and stored securely.

**Q: How do I export my data?**
A: Go to Profile > Privacy & Sharing > Export My Data. You'll receive a JSON file containing all your workouts, routes, and profile information.

**Q: How do I delete my data?**
A: Uninstalling HeartStrong removes all local data. If you've enabled cloud sync, you can delete your account from the app settings.

### Technical Issues

**Q: The app isn't tracking my location during outdoor workouts.**
A: Make sure you've granted location permissions. Go to iOS Settings > HeartStrong > Location and select "While Using the App" or "Always".

**Q: My workouts aren't appearing in Apple Health.**
A: Ensure HealthKit permissions are enabled. Go to iOS Settings > Health > Data Access & Devices > HeartStrong and enable all workout permissions.

**Q: The app is crashing or not loading.**
A: Try force-quitting the app and reopening it. If issues persist, try uninstalling and reinstalling. Your data synced to the cloud will be restored.
