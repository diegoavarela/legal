# NutriSnAIp Support

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How does the AI food analysis work?
Take a photo of your meal and our AI will analyze it to provide estimated calories, protein, carbs, and fat content. For best results, take clear, well-lit photos of your food.

### Why do I need a Pro subscription for AI features?
AI food analysis uses cloud-based AI services that have ongoing costs. The Pro subscription helps us maintain and improve these features.

### How accurate is the calorie tracking?
AI estimates are approximations based on visual analysis. For precise tracking, you can always manually adjust the values after scanning.

### Is my data private?
Yes. All your food logs, calories, and nutrition data are stored locally on your device. Food photos sent for AI analysis are not stored after processing.

### How do I cancel my subscription?
Go to Settings > Apple ID > Subscriptions on your iPhone, find NutriSnAIp, and tap Cancel Subscription.

### How do I restore my purchase on a new device?
Open the app, go to the paywall screen, and tap "Restore Purchases."

## Troubleshooting

### The camera isn't working
Make sure you've granted camera permissions in Settings > NutriSnAIp > Camera.

### AI analysis isn't returning results
Check your internet connection. AI features require an active internet connection.
